I am a scientist working at the intersections of quantum information science, photonics, and machine learning. My goal is to develop light-based quantum technologies that have an impact and to communicate science in clear and engaging ways.

My research interests revolve around numerical methods for designing and scaling quantum technologies, including computers, networks, and sensors; as well as how machine learning can be used for scientific discovery in physics. 

I am a Technical Lead at Ki3 Photonics Technologies, where I integrate quantum networking capabilities on top of classical telecommunications infrastructure.
I am also a founding contributor to [Open Quantum Design](https://openquantumdesign.org/), a non-profit organization aimed towards developing the world's first full-stack, open-source quantum computer.

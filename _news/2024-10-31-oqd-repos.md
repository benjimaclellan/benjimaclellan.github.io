[Open Quantum Design](https://openquantumdesign.org/) has now open-sourced our first set of software repos as part of our mission to build the world's first open-source quantum computer. 
Check out [`equilux`](https://github.com/OpenQuantumDesign/equilux) on Github, which 
includes [interfaces](https://github.com/OpenQuantumDesign/oqd-core) for programming quantum computers at analog and atomic layers,
[compiler infrastructure](https://github.com/OpenQuantumDesign/oqd-compiler-infrastructure),
[cloud provider tools](https://github.com/OpenQuantumDesign/oqd-cloud),
and an [emulator](https://github.com/OpenQuantumDesign/oqd-analog-emulator) for analog programs.

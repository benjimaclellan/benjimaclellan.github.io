Check out our recent work in collaboration between Ki3 Photonics, Quantum Bridge, PIQuIl, and Prof. Hoi Kwon Lo's group at the University of Toronto. 
We improve on the resources required to generate photonic graph states and provide a new design framework ([arXiv:2401.00635](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00635)), and release an accompanying open-source package [GraphiQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09285)!
